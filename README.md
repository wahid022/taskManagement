üöÄ Project Description

This Task Manager is designed to help users organize their daily workflow by keeping track of their to-dos. It demonstrates key React concepts like components, props, state, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), and conditional rendering. With a clean and intuitive UI, it supports task filtering, task completion toggling, and data persistence.

The project was completed as part of a 5-day assignment to evaluate practical skills in React development.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced & Solutions

1. State Synchronization with localStorage
Challenge: Ensuring tasks update instantly while remaining in sync with localStorage
Solution: Used useEffect to watch task state changes and update localStorage accordingly

2. Responsive Design
Challenge: Making the UI work well across different screen sizes
Solution: Used media queries and flexible layouts with CSS Flexbox

3. Filtering Without Breaking Task State
Challenge: Applying filters while maintaining original task state
Solution: Used state to manage the current filter and derived the filtered list dynamically
